This is a platform for showcasing a range of applications.

---

### Setup

-   **Frontend**:

    -   **Tools**: **Angular 18**, managed within an **Nx** workspace.
    -   **Platform Application Features**:
        -   **User Management**:
            -   Login and registration.
            -   Profile updates, account deletion, and preference management.
        -   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
            -   User roles: User, Premium User, Admin.
            -   Conditional access to sub-applications based on roles and feature flags (to be implemented).
        -   **Application Modularity**:
            -   Lazy-loading sub-applications for improved performance and scalability.
        -   **API Integration**:
            -   Utilizes **TanStack Query** to efficiently fetch and manage data from the backend REST API.
    -   **Shared Libraries**:
        -   **UI Library**:
            -   Built using **Carbon Design System**.
            -   Provides reusable components such as buttons, modals, and input fields to ensure consistent design across applications.
        -   **Utils Library**:
            -   Contains shared utility functions, services, and helpers to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
    -   **Storybook**:
        -   Used to document and visually test components from the shared UI library, ensuring consistency and reusability across the platform.

-   **Backend**:

    -   **Tools**: .NET 7 with Entity Framework.
    -   **Features**: REST API for platform services, user management, and role-based access.

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Infrastructure

-   **Docker**: Manages containerized versions of the frontend, backend, and database.
-   **Kubernetes (K3s)**: Provides container orchestration for scalable application deployment.
    -   **kubectl**: Command-line tool for managing Kubernetes resources.
    -   **K3d**: Manages K3s clusters within Docker for lightweight local clusters.
    -   **Skaffold**: Handles continuous development workflows with Kubernetes.

### Quick Reference SQL for Database Issues

#### Terminate Connections to Drop the Database

If you need to drop the database but connections are preventing it, use this SQL:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = '<database>'
  AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
```
