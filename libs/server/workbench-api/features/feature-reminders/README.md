# feature-reminders

API feature for `reminders` in the Workbench API.

This library was generated by the internal `workbench-api-feature` generator.  
It follows the pattern:

- `controller.ts` – Fastify handlers (request/response layer)
- `service.ts` – business logic / validation / orchestration
- `repo.ts` – data access (starts as in-memory, can move to DB)
- `types.ts` – shared TS types for service + repo
- `register-routes.ts` – Fastify route registration + schema wiring
- `index.ts` – public surface of the feature (what the main API imports)

Your contract shapes (Zod schemas and inferred types) should live in
`libs/server/workbench-api/contracts`, and be imported here from
`@edb-workbench/api/contracts`.
